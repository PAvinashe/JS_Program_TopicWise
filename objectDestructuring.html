    /*Object Destructuring:
     JavaScript Object Destructuring is the syntax for extracting values from an 
     object property and assigning them to a variable.
     The destructuring is also possible for JavaScript Arrays.
    */

   //Normal way to extract from an object property:

   const obj = {
  _name: "Priyanka",
  city: "Pune",
  mobileNo: 7383441173,
  education: "Bachelors",
  graduationCity: "Amravati",
}

// console.log(_name);

const _name1 = obj._name;
const city1 = obj.city;
const mobileNo1 = obj.mobileNo;
const education1 = obj.education;
const graduationCity1 = obj.graduationCity;

console.log(_name1);

const obj2 = {
  _name2: _name1,
  city2: city1,
  mobileNo2: mobileNo1,
  education2: education1,
  graduationCity2: graduationCity1,
}

//Using destructuring:

const obj0 = {
  _name: "Priyanka",
  city: "Pune",
  mobileNo: 7383441173,
  education: "Bachelors",
  graduationCity: "Amravati",
}

const { _name, city, mobileNo, education, graduationCity} = obj0;

const obj3 = {
  _name3: _name,
  city3: city,
  mobileNo3: mobileNo,
  education3: education,
  graduationCity3: graduationCity,
}

console.log(obj3);

// Array destructuring

let arr1 = ["John", "Smith"];

let [FN, LN, age=15] = arr1;
console.log(age)
